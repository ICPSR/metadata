# Request Changes or Additions to ICPSR Metadata

Modifications of ICPSR's metadata follow a four-step governance process:

![Schema Governance Process](assets/governance-process.png)

1. **Evaluate**: Using this documentation portal, an ICPSR team member evaluates the existing metadata properties to determine if the existing schema will meet their project needs.

2. **Request**: If existing metadata do not meet the project's needs, the ICPSR team member should email the Metadata & Preservation team at 'icpsr-metadata [at] umich [dot] edu' and submit a metadata change request spreadsheet. To do so, make a copy of the [Metadata Change Request Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lXMFKpQchPqNA4_Km3aEjaKiiDvgf2OarXlT-u7YOKs/copy) and provide the following information for each element:

    * **Reason for the Change:**: Use this column to provide an explanation or justification of why the metadata change is needed.
    * **Metadata Element Name**: Use this column to provide the name of each metadata element in the change request. If you propose a new metadata element, the Metadata & Preservation Team may suggest an alternate name for clarity or consistency.
    * **New or Updated Element**: Use this column to indicate if the requested change is for a new metadata element or to an existing one.
    * **Element Definition**: Use this column to propose a definition for the metadata element. Please note that the Metadata & Preservation Team may work with you to revise any proposed definitions for clarity and consistency.
    * **Required?**: Use this column to indicate if the metadata element should be required or optional.
    * **Repeatable?**: Use this column to indicate if the metadata element should be repeatable (i.e., if the element should be an array or list that can hold multiple values).
    * **Accepted values**: Use this column to indicate accepted values for the metadata element. You may indicate general data type (e.g., text, number, boolean) or provide specific references to text formats (e.g., a timestamp) or controlled vocabularies.
    * **Examples**: Use this column to provide examples of valid values.
    * **Additional Information**: Use this column to provide any additional information about the metadata element, accepted values, proposed guidance for users, etc.
     
3. **Review**: The Metadata & Preservation team will engage with the team member, provide feedback on submitted materials, and determine whether the proposed changes will be accepted. In cases where a change is rejected, M&P will work with the team member to ensure that project needs are addressed via an alternate solution. CNS will provide an additional review to ensure that any proposed changes will not result in technical problems or data integrity issues.

4. **Publish**: The Metadata & Preservation team will introduce approved changes into ICPSR's local metadata schema and work with CNS to implement them in production metadata.
