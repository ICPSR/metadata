# ICPSR Bulk Metadata Export API Documentation

ICPSR is producing a new application programming interface (API) to allow community members to perform bulk exports of metadata records. This new API will help ICPSR simplify and standardize the process of creating metadata records across its systems and at the same time allow users to have more control over which metadata records they want.

While the Metadata  API is currently still under development, this page will serve as a clearinghouse for related information and user documentation.

## ICPSR Metadata Mappings

The ICPSR Metadata API will initially produce records using the following schema: [DCAT-US](https://resources.data.gov/resources/dcat-us/), [MARCXML](https://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/), and [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/). Other export formats will follow!

To better understand how ICPSR's local metadata schema maps to elements in the above standards, please consult this [ICPSR Metadata API Mappings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Avw212FfzxRjsUFvlJOLtsJclKeL8VJc0pbhLQevXg8/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet.
