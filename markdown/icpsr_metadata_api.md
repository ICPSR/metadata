# ICPSR Metadata API Documentation

## Under Development: A New API to Export Metadata!

ICPSR is developing a new application programming interface (API) so that community members can perform bulk exports of metadata records. This new API will:
 - Simplify and standardize the process of accessing metadata records.
 - Allow ICPSR to provide metadata in a broader range of standards and formats.
 - Support more complex queries so that users can find the metadata records that best meet their needs.

## ICPSR Metadata API Mappings

Upon its release, the ICPSR Metadata API will produce records that conform to the following standards (with more to come in the future): 
 - [DCAT-US](https://resources.data.gov/resources/dcat-us/)
 - [MARCXML](https://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/)
 - [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/). 

This [Metadata API Mappings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Avw212FfzxRjsUFvlJOLtsJclKeL8VJc0pbhLQevXg8/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet provides more information about how ICPSR metadata elements align with the above-mentioned standards.
