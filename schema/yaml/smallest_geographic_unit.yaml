  usageNotes: |
    Geographic Unit is intended to represent specific, known geography -- e.g., county, census district, FIPS code, electoral district, and any other conveyor of specific geography that is represented by a variable.

    If the data do not include a geographic variable by which the data can be analyzed, this element is not indicated. If all the cases are from a single state, but the cases are not subdivided geographically within that state, then 'state' is not indicated.

    This element is only meant to convey specific, known, geography. If there is a variable indicating which testing site a survey was taken at, but the locations of the testing sites were masked by the PI, this element is likely not indicated.
