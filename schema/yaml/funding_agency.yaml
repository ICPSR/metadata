    The following steps should be taken to make sure that the entry of funding agency names conforms to best practices within ICPSR and the broader academic community:

      1. If the funding agency has sponsored data with ICPSR in the past, conform to previously usage within the ICPSR catalog.
      2. If the organization has not previously sponsored data but is in the [ICPSR Organization Names Authority List](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10004), use the form of the name listed there.
      3. If the funding agency is not available in the ICPSR Organizational Names Authority List, consult the [Virtual International Authority File](https://viaf.org/) (VIAF). 
      4. If the funding agency does not have a VIAF record, consult another authoritative source (such as an organizational website) to determine the appropriate name.
