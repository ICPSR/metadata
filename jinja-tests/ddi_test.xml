The files have been zipped by NACJD for release, but not checked or processed except for the removal of direct identifiers. Users should refer to the accompanying readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collection and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.The objective of this project was to enhance understanding of violent disputes by examining the use of aggression to rectify a perceived wrong. It also sought to identify the factors that determine if retaliatory violence occurs within disputes as well as to understand how long retaliatory disputes last, and what factors lead to the termination of such disputes. This collection includes two SPSS data files: &amp;quot;Dispute_Database_for_NACJD.sav&amp;quot; with 40 variables and 111 cases and &amp;quot;Northeastern_City_Violence_Database_NACJD_submission.sav&amp;quot; with 164 variables and 1,303 cases.</abstract>

Towards that end, this project had five specific aims:To leverage police data to expand knowledge on dispute-related violenceTo examine qualitative differences across disputesTo identify the factors that determine if retaliatory violence occurs within disputesTo understand how long retaliatory disputes last and what factors lead to the termination of such disputesTo identify those factors that influence whether a dispute turns lethal</abstract>
      <abstract contentType="mixed">STUDY DESIGN: Data for this project were collected from investigative documents of a police department in a Northeastern city. These documents were coded to create two quantitative datasets. The first dataset is a dispute-level data set.  This dataset was created by coding 111 dispute bulletins from the Northeastern City Police Department. The second data set was an individual-level dataset that included data from assaultive violence in Northeastern city from 2010 to 2012.</abstract>
