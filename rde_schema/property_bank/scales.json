  "description": "Any commonly known scales used to collect data for the data collection (e.g., MMPI, CPI, the Census Occupational Codes, etc.).",
  "type": "string",
  "usageNotes": "Include common scales that can be readily identified from the data, documentation, or other related materials. ICPSR curators are not expected to infer or research scales that are not explicitly indicated. The scales can be cited either as a list or described in full sentences. If the questionnaire used has a finite list of responses (e.g., 'Always, Sometimes, Rarely, Never' or Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree'), it is acceptable for this element to note 'A Likert-type scale was used,' or 'Several Likert-type scales were used.' However, it is not required to note Likart-type scales in situations where only such scales were used, given their ubiquity.",

      "The baseline data collection included one scale - the CES-D index for maternal depression [Cole, J. C., Rabin, A. S., Smith, T. L., and Kaufman, A. S. (2004). Development and validation of a Rasch-derived CES-D short form. Psychological assessment, 16(4), 360]. All scales used for outcomes at ages 1 through 3 are listed in Appendix Tables 1 and 2 in the User Guide. Please refer to the User Guide and P.I. Codebook, available under the 'Data and Documentation' tab, for details."
