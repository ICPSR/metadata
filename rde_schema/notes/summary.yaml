    The Summary may include information about the different parts of the data collection not adequately conveyed by the Fileset names or found elsewhere in the metadata. Other important components include a listing of major variables or categories of variables (with examples) as well as an indication of the data collection's unit of analysis (i.e., who or what is being studied: individuals, housing units, courts, criminal acts, etc.). Most often the unit of analysis is the individual; where it is not, it is particularly important to make this clear.
    
    The Summary is written in the third person and avoids attempting to address issues of how the data might be used, who might be interested in the data, or any evaluative comments about the worth or usefulness of the data collection. The Summary uses past tense when describing the process of collecting the data and present tense when necessary, such as when describing the data (e.g., 'The MIDUS Refresher collection is split into two datasets.'). Numerals are used instead of spelling them out; if a number is spelled out for emphasis, the number is attached in parentheses (e.g. 'Two thousand (2,000)').
