    Time Periods focus on the dates the data are actually about, regardless of when the data were collected. 
    
    Time Periods generally correspond to the dates that appear in the Title; days and months may be included in the Time Period even though they are not in the Title.

    Dates are formatted as YYYY, YYYY-MM, or YYYY-MM-DD. No spaces are permitted in date expressions.
